# Entrance of Theme Park
This is a Spike-controlled module with two modes, one python file for each:

## Flow-balancing Mode

This mode attempts to use the outer track for storing minifigs when there is a high flow, and insert from the outer track when the flow is low.

## Interactive Mode

For this mode the distance sensor is used to activate the outer track.
