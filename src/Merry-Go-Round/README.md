# Merry-Go-Round

The MMM module Merry-Go-Round is modelled after the ride in the classic game Theme Park by Bullfrog Productions.

The python files in this folder should simply be copied into [the online editor](https://spike.legoeducation.com/).

At the time where this code is made, LEGO Education Spike Prime python programming does not allow for importing custom files, so the required files are inlined, causing a mess in this code base.

Use Reset.py as a standalone program for resetting the Merry-Go-Round, and Merry-Go-Round.py for the main loop to be run.
